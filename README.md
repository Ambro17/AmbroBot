# CuervoBot
CuervoBot is a Bot that learns new commands as i get more things to study. Studying sometimes is boring. Coding is always fun (and a good excuse to not feel guilty about not studying).

It can set reminders, search series or movies for you, tell you if you should take the subway or not, and even help you solve system of linear equations!


## Installation
First clone the project and install requirements.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Ambro17/AmbroBot.git
$ cd AmbroBot
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then open telegram and chat `@BotFather` to get a bot token. Once you have it add `PYTEL` environment variable with the token.
For example, if you use Linux with zsh shell you should add this line to the end of your ~/.zshrc file

`export PYTEL=<BotToken>`

If you are on windows you can do it with a GUI, or with powershell. See [this link](https://superuser.com/questions/949560/how-do-i-set-system-environment-variables-in-windows-10) for instructions

Additional environment variables are needed for the bot to work properly. 

```
TMDB_KEY # To access movies and series
DATABASE_URL # Database to persist information
CABA_SECRET # Transport updates
CABA_CLI_ID # Transport updates
```

Once you have all packages installed and all environment variables set you can run the  bot with

`$ python3 main.py`
